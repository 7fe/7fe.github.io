Traditionally I have hated Disney which I still do
 - 1 show I ever liked on Disney was Phineas and Ferb that is it
 - Captain Marvel is okay although I don't like the female lead
 - Ralph breaks the internet is okay but I don't believe it
 - Every time Disney buys a company their movies turn to sh*t
 - Netlfix stuff is mostly bad also.  The only series I have enjoyed on Netflix are Weeds(dark comedy) and Breaking Bad(Dark Comedy)
 - Warner Bros. horry movies are good the rest are bad now.
 
The entertainment company I like is Google and traditionaly 21st century fox.
 
Satan is sitting on the Sistine chapel

I like Jared Leto 30 Seconds to Mars and Fall Out Boy.

Disney fucked America because females are concerned about money.
Girls can essentially care about cost.  Price of freedom.

In addition Disney Movies encourage girls to be on a super happy side.
Disney Movies encourage people to listen to their voice.

Although females hold less political power in the US
I would argue they essentially have it better in the United States.


Why I hate Lion King
 - The lion king is to perfect
 - I don't like the place of all the animals in the lion king 
   it reminds me of the communist type nature of america
 - everyone has their place aka communism
 
Why I hate Forrest Gump
 - to start with Forrest Gump is tall
 - girls like tall guys 
 - In addition football is a lot harder than it looks
 
Do the poor and unfortunate go to church?
Haven't decided not sure.
Can't think of church advice that I have gotten that is good.
Don't meet many people in church that I admire or look up to.

So I have a question.
Binary is associated with Satanism.

Military
 - So I find it interesting that the military that the military pays so poorly for doctors 
 - Plus, Army doctors often work shorter hours than their civilian colleagues. They enjoy regular vacations and excellent benefits. They have a guaranteed job with generous retirement benefit
 - Army captain is $44,543 a year, while the median salary of a general practice civilian physician is $119,122
