</a>

Prisons are deadly places people die of Illnesses.
Homocides and Suicides.
You need to show death murder suicide homocides.
It needs to be rated R and it may help not sure.
Even if someone believes in something like me
I will only die if it changes the future. 

Suicide is the leading cause of death in correctional facilities,
and multiple studies indicate as many as half of all inmate suicides
are committed by the estimated 15 % to 20% of inmates with serious mental illness.
A 2002 study in the state of Washington found that “the prevalence of mental illness 
among inmates who attempted suicide was 77%, compared with 15% [among inmates] in the 
general jail population.” In California in 2002, the Los Angeles Times headlined: 
“Jail Suicides Reach Record Pace in State,” and added: “Some experts blame the recent
 surge on forcing more of the mentally ill behind bars.”

2 Movies would fix this issue
1) Scream(better then all of those)
 2) Scream Prison movie is the best bet but it will never happen need to be based on real life scenario.
 3) You need the violence to be a joke but make it clear
    tons of people are dying.  You see really really scary murder movies in Jail won't work.
 4) Scary movie is similar
 5) You also need to create a similar prison movie that is like Shutter Island that exhibits the suicide issue
    and murders that aren't seen on camera.  It can also exhibit the mental health issues.

Really Really Bad Examples
 1) Shawshank Redemption (Get out of Jail)
 2) The Godfather (Mafia)
 3) The Dark Knight (Exits stage left on police)
 4) The Godfather Part II (Mafia)
 5) Fight Club (doing something illegal)
 6) The Human Centipede 3 (doesn't demonstrate murder seems unrealistic)
 7) Escape Plan
 8) Escape Plan

Presents prevalence estimates of mental health indicators among state and federal prisoners and jail inmates
by different time periods, demographics, criminal justice history, most serious offense, mental health treatment 
received while incarcerated, and rule violations. Indicators were defined as serious psychological distress (SPD)
in the 30 days prior to the interview or having a history of a mental health problem. Data are from BJS's 2011-2012 
National Inmate Survey. Comparisons to the general population are based on data from the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration's National Survey on Drug Use and Health, conducted in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012.

Highlights:

More jail inmates (26%) than prisoners (14%) met the threshold for serious psychological distress (SPD) in the past 30 days.
Among those who had ever been told they had a mental disorder, the largest percentage of prisoners (24%) and jail inmates (31%)
reported they had a major depressive disorder.
More prisoners (14%) and jail inmates (26%) met the threshold  for SPD in the past 30 days than the standardized general population (5%).
Prescription medication was the most common treatment type for prisoners and jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD in the past 30 days.
Fourteen percent of prisoners and 10% of jail inmates who met the threshold for SPD in the past 30 days were written up or charged with assault
