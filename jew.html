Job 3:2 "He said:"

If a girl doesn't want to spend her life alone
she comes to the the South because there
are lots of Christian guys.
But that doesn't always work.

I believe in Jesus Christ but the bible is really really really imperfect.
Church of Christ is the only church I can attend because of the music.
I can't list to music command with females voices.

mainline protestant is declining in America
mainline protestant is Australia
mainline protestant is New Zealand

3 types of people go to Church
 1) Those that have to
 2) Those that love church
 3) Finally those that have a spouse that loves Church

Problems I have with Chrisianity
 1) light and darkness
 2) eye for an eye
 3) slavery is viewed differently in the new testament then old testament https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_Bible
 4) https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Banana_argument
 5) Everything in the Bible is highly abstract.
 6) Jesus cried.

Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, "I am the Light of the world; he who follows
Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life." John 8:12 for 
you were formerly darkness, but now you are Light in the Lord; walk as children of Light Ephesians 5:8

For God, who said, "Light shall shine out of darkness," is the One who has shone in our hearts to 
give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. 2 Corinthians 4:6

The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. John 1:5

See females like the Bible and the names in the Bile
because of the high vowel frequency.  
 
Samuel, Gabriel, Steven, Alexander, Joseph, Jesus

You see they Bible has no actual short names for the book of the bible
except for John and Job(which isn't use commonly for a name).
You see if they wanted the bible to stay as it is they would have
just left the Jewish names but instead they adopted "Englishy" 
names that satisified females sexual desires.
 
It makes them think of sex while being common names to use in 
society.

I love men more then women but according to the baby sex is between a man and women.

I have decided that Keeping 2 religious Judaism and Christianity 
is the best possible thing to do.

Ironically China(communist) and India are holding a certain type
of freedom I won't mention. 

Solar Eclipse and the wrath of the Gods.

In Christianity light and dark are used metaphors for good and evil
In Judaism they are not used that way at all

fox and hound
majority and minority

If someone is going to shave my testicles
I would want more then anything 

slavery is not encouraged and talked about in the old testament but it is in the new testament in ways like that

"Let me know if you want me to warm it up for you." nope
look at a girl that is pretty. nope

2 types of people question the bible engineers and people with reading disabilities

the mass revelation of the judaism in the bible 

attention vs intention

if girls want pornography to end they should only have guys take
the right hand path

Judaism(1.0) was combined with Hinduism(.5) to make Christianity.
In the modern world we need to a new religion to stop homelessness
but it will never ever happen unfortunately. 

exodus2218 “You shall not permit a sorceress/sorcerer to live."
ephesians21 "Satan will get his power from the kingdom of air." right hand path
Genesis 3:18 "For out of the ground we were taken for the dust we are, and to the dust we shall return."

Transgender people should choose between two pronouns he and she in the United States because
in reality we have it better then other countries like Spain or France because noun verb agreement.
If you use there first name because of the gender neutral language it all works out
and we are highly religious which is primarily Christian.
If you want transgender to be a thing you should have picked a different religion.

When you eat of the forbidden fruit their is a loss of love and respect for females.
At the same time you love the more then anyone else in the world.
You see a guy must be a winner for a girl.

Logically eternal life doesn't make sense but I should respect those 
concepts and ideologies.  

Claire Bear
Joseph had not eaten of the forbidden fruit had a son and invested everything he had into it.

Satan is sitting on the Sistine chapel.

I support gay marriage but not gay sex.  "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a women; that is detestable."
