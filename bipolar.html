<!--p> In the year 2013 I passed out in Emergency Room.  Later I was voluntarily admitted to a mental hospital and subsequently diagnosed with bipolar or schizophrenia.  With in a year I received three different diagnoses of OCD, bipolar and schizophrenia.</p>
<p>

</p>
Mental Health especially Bipolar and Schizophrenia are very uncertain non direct diagnsoses.
This study by Stanford explains that the default diagnosis. <br>
<p>My Testosterone levels went from in the normal levels 270 to 1070 ng/dL with an average level of 679 ng/dL.</p-->
Move to any antipychotic and simple replace pills.
Buy dissolvable pills and create you own label to go in orange container(this can be tricky because you have to pick up the prescription).

30% of bipolar patienst are on major tranquilzers or antipychotics.

Life expectancy of bipolar people are really short.

OCD typically take antidepressents.

Paradoxical Insomnia

Richard A. Kunin homepathic doctor

However, there is one technical point that I have never, not once, in 8 years, seen written about, discussed, or even alluded to, and when you do bring it up people look at you blankly: the study patients were stabilized on meds, then randomized to drug or placebo.  So those that were randomized to placebo had their stabilizing meds stopped.  They were "taken off their meds."  So actually, being on Depakote was not simply no better than placebo, it was no better than abruptly going off your meds.  Take a long hard look at yourselves.

Despite this lack of evidence, a 2007 study found nearly 1 in 4 (21 percent) of individuals who sought treatment for anxiety were prescribed an antipsychotic.

Historic, comprehensive study shows 20 fold increases of suicide in today's drug treated patients

Animal studies confirmed this picture too. Philip Seeman reported
that antipsychotics caused an increase in D2 receptors in rats,
and while the density of these receptors could revert to normal if the
drug was withdrawn (he reported that for every month of exposure,
it took two months for renormalization to occur), at some point the
increase in receptors became irreversible.

Chronic insomnia here. I take two forms of Seroquel (also for my bipolar disorder) which do help. When I was pregnant I took Zyprexa (anti-psychotic) and slept really well. But I'm not sure that they would prescribe these just for sleep, but you never know!

http://bluelight.org/vb/threads/699830-Soma-for-sleeping-better-than-benzo?p=11961114&viewfull=1#post11961114

I've been on .8mg Clonazepam and 1mg of Zyprexa at bedtime for chronic insomnia. It's not a great sleep aid choice, but I have tardive akathisia and it is the only combination that works. I also have hyperacidity and came across Melatonin as a possible solution for it. I'm looking to take 5mg of Melatonin with the current .8mg Clonazepam / 1mg Zyprexa regimine. I've heard there can be interactions between Clonazepam and Melatonin so I want to be careful; however the acidity is really nasty and I would really like to try the Melatonin. Unfortunately proton pump inhibitors don't work for the acidity. Has anyone taken Clonazepam and Melatonin in approximately these dosages? Thanks for everyone's input.

Any out there besides me suffer from chronic insomnia? Where trazadone, remeron, doxepin, melatonin, benadryl products, chances are if you list a medication I've tried it and its an epic fail. I refuse seroquel. Idk if it works but I went to rehab (tried to get sober and learned about my new diagnosis) when I was 20 when I was 95 pounds and gained 50 pounds (no lie) I am overweight for my height and I'm short and I've heard nothing but nightmare stories of zyprexa risperdal and seroquel and I refuse to be put back on those drugs. Does any one relate to me? How do you cope with your insomnia? It makes my depression and anxiety go through the roof!!!


- When I stopped the medication, i did not sleep for 4 days. Whats worse is, I just didn't feel tired anymore...obviously I feel physically tired, but I dont get that sleepy tired feeling. I called my doctor and he asked that I slowly wean off the medication, I began using it again and although i was able to sleep, again I did not feel tired - AT ALL! This is wierd as one could logically dictate if stopping the zyprexa was causing me to not sleep than once i started it i should feel the same way i did prior to stopping it. But I don't. 

I have now completed weaning off the zyprexa for one month. Still problems sleeping, I AM sleeping 4-5 hours a night, but I DO NOT FEEL TIRED I CAN'T GET SLEEPY NO MATTER WHAT!! My psychiatrist has tried me on ambien, lunesta, Ive' even used 2 lunesta and I DO NOT GET SLEEPY! 

I've done research on sleep disorders, zyprexa withdrawal, etc. and a lot of information states that zyprexa withdrawal can cause insomnia. However, is this the same as not feeling sleepy? Its been a month and I haven't been tired and whats even wierder is that i wasn't tired when i got back on the zyprexa after stopping it for 4 days. I am wondering if i am ever going to be sleepy tired again. Its been a month now. I called my psychiatrist office yesterday and he wanted to try using lunesta, ambien, and a tryclic antidepressant to put me to sleep. I'm paranoid after using zyprexa as i feel that stopping it cold turkey could have started all this. Even after getting back on the zyprexa after stopping it cold turkey, i dont feel tired at all! Could something have happened to me during the 4 day lapse that caused some kind of imbalance in my brain that stopped me from feeling tired alltogether? As when i got back on the zyprexa it didn't help things but i was sleeping but still no feeling of getting tired whatsoever. I'm thinking of seeing a sleep specialist and going back to see my psychiatrist this week. he says hes never heard of nor seen such symptoms after stopping zyprexa. Please help. I haven't felt sleepy tired in over a month! and although i do get 4 hours of sleep every night or so, it is VERY hard to fall asleep as i am NOT TIRED AT ALL. Please help

#Psychiatric Drug Withdrawal A Guide for Prescribers, Therapists, Patients and their Families

These drugs produce a chemical suppression of the frontal lobes and reticular activating system.

CATIE study 

NIMH 6-week trail found that "patients who received placebo treatment were less likely to be rehospitalized than those who received any of three active phenothiazines"

Another NIMH study found that relapse was significantly correlated with increasing doses of antipsychotic drugs.

A recent study indicated that the off-label use of risperidone as an adjunt to anitdepressants in the treatment of military related post-traumatic stress "did not reduce PTSD symptons"

Accumulating evidence that long-term exposure to antipyschotic drugs does far more harm than good should encourage practitioners, patients, and family to consider medication withdrawal in order to avert long-term exposure.

Antipsychotics drugs are highly toxic and produce many potentially severe and even lethal adverse effects, such as chronic brain impairment(CBI); atrophy of the brain; tardrive dyskinesia(TD) including tardive psychosis and persistent cognitive impairment; neuroleptic syndrome(NMS); and metabolic syndrome including obesy; elevated cholesterol, elevated blood sugar and potentially lethal diabetes.

Diabetes: A study of about 9,000 Americans found that those who overslept had a 50 percent higher risk of developing diabetes than people who slept the recommended amount each night. A similar risk has also been found in those who sleep less than five hours per night.

And if it is a scheduled drug it is NOT LEGAL to buy ANY schedule 2 narcotic online.You can do years in prison.Is it worth it?

Little evidence that antidepressants work as anything more then a placebo.

 http://www.healthyplace.com/diabetes/mental-health/which-atypical-antipsychotics-carry-the-highest-risk-for-diabetes/

	Numerous and well-documented studies have shown a serious and potentially dangerous connection between certain second generation antipsychotics and the risk of diabetes because of their connection to metabolic syndrome. Those atypical antipsychotics with the highest risk for developing diabetes are:
	
	Clorazil (clozapine)
	Zyprexa (olanzipine)
	In a major NIMH study (the CATIE project), Zyprexa was associated with relatively severe metabolic effects. Subjects taking Zyprexa showed a major weight gain problem and increases in glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides. The average weight gain over the 18-month study period was 44 pounds.
	
	Medium risk antipsychotics are:
	
	Seroquel (quetiapine)
	Risperdal (risperidone)
 
Pete Wentz is bipolar and to quote, "I don't take any medication"

"Was on Zyprexa from Mar 2015 till Aug 2015. At first it seemed like it was mellowing me out a bit, and I could sleep through the whole night, which was an improvement. After a few months I noticed my depression was getting much worse. Came off the drug cold turkey, and went through one of the most serious withdrawals one could face. Depression, severe anxiety, PTSD, night terrors took over. To this day Apr 2016, I have still not returned to the way I was before I started taking this horrible drug. Depression and anxiety are still bad, not as bad as 6 mos ago, but still worse than when I first started taking it. I'm convinced this drug can cause permanent brain damage."

Schizophrenia

This is why regular medical treatment is important because it can show whether the person would improve with adequate functioning with treatment or will still struggle to perform competitive work. It also allows the possibility of getting a medical opinion from your treating provider regarding your functioning, which could easily make the difference in being approved. If Social Security finds the person’s schizophrenia is severe, they will next determine if it would qualify for the medical listing.

In order to qualify for the listing, a person has to have medically documented findings that are continuous or intermittent of at least one of four scenarios. The first scenario is delusions or hallucinations. The second scenario is catatonic or other significant disorganized behavior. The third scenario is incoherence, loosening of associations, illogical thinking, or poverty of content of speech in addition to a blunt, flat or inappropriate affect. The last scenario is emotional withdrawal or isolation.

 1. delusions or hallucinations
 2. catatonic or other significant disorganized behavior
 3. illogical thinking
 4. emotional withdrawal or isolation
 
"The majority of users of antipsychotics (88%) were polysubstance users. Quetiapine was, by far, the most abused antipsychotic (84.9%). Other atypical antipsychotics identified included zyprexa/olanzapine (17.8%), risperidone (24.7%), aripiprazole (20.5%), ziprasidone (8.1%), and asenapine (2.9%)."
 
 "7Acute symptoms such as sweating, insomnia, tremor, anxiety, nausea and vomiting have been reported when olanzapine is stopped abruptly."
 
In addition, the schizophrenia has to significantly affect the person’s ability to perform at least two of the following: activities of daily living; dealing with other people; maintaining concentration, persistence or pace or repeated periods of decompensation for extended time. A period of decompensation for example would be a hospitalization for a ninety-six hour stay.

Even if the medical evidence does not quite match up with those requirements, Social Security will still consider it along with any other medical conditions you have to decide whether they will keep you from performing competitive employment. The important key is to get treatment and report ongoing symptoms from your schizophrenia. In addition, it helps to get into a support group such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI)  and be with other people who understand how it feels to have a mental illness.

You will need to present evidence that your depression is so severe that you are unable to work.

Extremely rare that i prescribe zyprexa, unless for some reason weight gain (that tends to occur very frequently with zyprexa) is desired.
Metabolic syndrome and diabetes are also not uncommon adverse effects. If a medication in this class is required, I think Abilify (aripiprazole) at lowest effective dose is often helpful with a relatively low incidence of the serious side effects very often seen with zyprexa.
