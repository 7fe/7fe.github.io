Scroll to top of page - Accessibility Settings

I would like to create an application that automatically scrolls to the top of the page by using Accessibility settings in Android and disguising the application as either a home screen launcher or by swiping from the bottom or other sides of the screen(not sure of the api's required for this).  Basically when you double tap the home button(or swipe from one of the sides of the screen) it should scroll to the top of whatever app is open.  There are a couple applications that nearly do what I need them to do(so it should be possible) but I need someone to create the finished project.

Home2Shorcut basically works by registering itself as Homescreen launcher but I have a feeling launching another application is not necessarily a good idea.  Unfortunately I'm not 100% sure if double tapping a home button will work because you will need to make launch as another application and return to the existing one.  These are the settings to required to get Volkey to scroll to the top of the page https://i.stack.imgur.com/v0LSt.png https://i.stack.imgur.com/5yuM0.png  Another app that works similar is Kinetic Scroll which has a dedicated widget button that is displayed on top to scroll to the top of the page https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktQNH.png  I fairly certain I should be able to do what Sidebar, Edge Screen, Pie Control is triggered by swiping from one of the sides of the screen.  Settings page shown here https://i.stack.imgur.com/BcJzU.png

Reasons I continue to use an iPhone

1) Scroll to the top of the page https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvJDXTNblbQ
2) Hold home button to activate Siri without unlocking phone. There is no Google Assistant button on most Android devices except the Samsung S8. I want to be able to activate with headphones on while in my pocket without having to count on Ok Google.  I experimented with creating an app that is trigged by double tapping the power button but ultimately it was to glitchy.
3) Album covers are displayed like this on Android. https://img.gadgethacks.com/img/25/61/63562663618448/0/disab... While on my iPhone it looks like this http://community.oppo.com/en/forum.php?mod=oppo_attachment_x... I want to see the entire album cover. (No longer true in iOS 11) 
4) The battery life is better on my iPhone especially when listening to music.
5) Notification dots don't display numbers even in Oreo 8.0
6) Spotify reording of songs.
7) Icon layout makes more sense.  I like how the iPhone fills up the space with icons automatically so I don't have manually drag stuff around.
8) iPhone displays city, state for receiving phone numbers.

Album Covers may or may not be able to get the NextSong not really sure.  NextSong gets the song name and album cover
